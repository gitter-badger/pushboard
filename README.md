PUSHBOARD

[ ![Codeship Status for idodev/pushboard](https://www.codeship.io/projects/5a908a70-3c61-0132-2ad5-7642376dcec1/status)](https://www.codeship.io/projects/42968)

An open platform for the collection, display and action of data.


Send data to the REST API (through a variety of wrappers) and configure how you want to display that data on your wallboard. Additionally configure conditional post event hooks on any of your data streams to act on your behalf.


I'm in the early stages of discovery with this project, there will be many ommisions, and it at anypoint may not be functioning. consider yourselves warned!
